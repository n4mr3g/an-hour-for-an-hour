# An Hour For An Hour

A web app where people come to offer one hour of their time for an hour of what they would like to learn.

### Problem Statement

The aim of the project is to introduce a new approach to online learning. Online learning is currently booming with more and more people taking it up for both personal and professional reasons.

Majority of online learning happens with prerecorded materials and while it certainly has its pros, what it canâ€™t replace is the experience of learning on a one to one setting that not only helps us learn but has the potential to extend our social connection, improve interpersonal skills and build lasting friendships with whom we learn and share our skills with.

### Solution

An app that will be the platform for what we do in real life, learn and share our skills directly with people one on one.


### Legacy Project Refactoring

## Findings:
  -- NPM dependencies in package.json were missing
